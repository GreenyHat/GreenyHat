## Hi there!! I'm GreenyHat ðŸ¤™


First things first, I'm a huge fan of craft beer, the Big Bang Theory series and the beginnings of apocalyptic movies.. ðŸ˜„ 

ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm diving deep into Java, SpringFramework, PHP and SQL as I continue my path to becoming a backend developer. 

ðŸš€ I've got a keen interest in AI, Big Data and cybersecurity. It's just fascinating to think about how machines can learn and how we can make our digital world safer.

ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on projects that align with my current skill set. Always eager to learn and contribute.

âš¡ Fun fact: Have you ever wondered if AI will someday provide a polynomial-time solution for a discrete logarithm? That would be a bad business... Let's chat about it!
