## Hi there!! I'm GreenyHat 🤙


First things first, I'm a huge fan of craft beer, the Big Bang Theory series and the beginnings of apocalyptic movies.. 😄 

🌱 At the moment, I'm diving deep into Java, SpringFramework, XML, and SQL as I carve my path towards becoming a backend developer. 

🚀 I've got a keen interest in AI and cybersecurity. It's just fascinating to think about how machines can learn and how we can make our digital world safer.

🌐 I've got networks on my learning radar next. If you've got any resources or tips, shoot them!

👯 Looking to collaborate on projects that align with my current skill set. Always eager to learn and contribute.

💼 A goal without a plan is just a wish, right? Mine is to grow constantly as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects.

⚡ Fun fact: Have you ever wondered if AI will someday provide a polynomial-time solution for a discrete logarithm? That would be a bad business... Let's chat about it!
